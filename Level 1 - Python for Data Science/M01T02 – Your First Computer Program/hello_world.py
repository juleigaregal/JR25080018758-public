# Understand what the algorithm needs to do
# The code needs to have a user input their name and age separately
# Code needs to output "Hello, World!"

#Get user to input name
#print out the name
#Get user to input age
#print out the age
#print "Hello, World!"

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name)
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print (age)
