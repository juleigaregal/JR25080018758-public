1.An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were entered.

# Need to hold the inputs of the user, so that eventually it can find the maximum value that was entered from all the inputs
# Once the user enters 0, find the largest integer in the input data
# need a way to store all the inputs from the user
# find the maximum value that user entered

user enters integer
set x = [] define a variable that can store all the values that the user enters
prompt user to input positive number
while input is positive
prompt user to enter number
store numbers in X
if input = 0
find max value in array[x]


2.An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello, World”.

set variable first_name
request user to input first_name
print first_name + 'Hello World'

3.An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

Read in arbitrary integers (assuming data is stored in a file,  read in this file)
x = arbitrary_integers (stores the data in a variable)
Calculate Sum(x)/(Count number of arbitrary integers in x)

4.An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.

# Would need the user to input each time they purchase a product from the list
# Would need the data containing the entire grocery list
# Once user inputs item from the list, the algorithm would need to compare the inputs in the list against the grocery list
# print out the missing items in the list in alphabetical order

grocery_list = [Apple, Flour, Sugar, Tea, Coffee, Milk]
item_purchased = []
Prompt user to enter item_purchased
Compare grocery_list to item_purchased
If items in grocery_list matches items_purchased
then 'complete'
Else 
Set Remaining_items = [grocery_list] - [item_purchased]
Print Remaining_items sort alphabetical order ascending

5.
Ask user to enter two numbers
set  x = user_input
set y = user_input
Create a variable S
Set S = x+y (Add x and y and store variable in S)
Set A = S/2 (Divide S by 2 and store variable in A)
Set P = x*y (multiply x and y and store value in variable P)
Print S, A, P
